## About

The housing was modeled in Autodesk Fusion and adapted as best as possible to the dimensions of the Diabolic Parasite. Due to the offset between the USB male and USB female connectors, the housing is unfortunately slightly thicker than standard USB devices.
Both housing parts can be printed without support structures and, when printed with a perfectly calibrated printer, fit together so well that no gluing is necessary.

The 3D models may be modified. However, it would be desirable to mention the author.
